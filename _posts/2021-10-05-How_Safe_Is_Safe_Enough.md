There are many different organisations which evaluate vehicle safety, such as the New Car Assesment Programme <a href="https://www.globalncap.org/ncaps" target="_blank">(NCAP)</a> which opperates internationally, The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety <a href="https://www.iihs.org/ratings" target="_blank">(IIHS)</a>  which is a US non profit organisation, or The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings" target="_blank">(NHTSA)</a> which is a department of the US government.

These organisations score and rank vehicles on their safety preformance across many different areas. These areas include both occupant safety and pedestrian safety. The results of these tests all point towards the same thing, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/newer-cars-are-safer-cars">cars are getting safer</a>.
In this post I will be looking at what it takes to get these high safety scores in terms of head impacts and to answer the question of *how safe is safe enough*.

## Head Injury ##
An Abriviated Injury Scale (AIS) was developed by emergency room physicians to quantify the severity of injuries to specific body parts such as the head. These range from AIS1 which is a minor head injury to an AIS5 which is a critical head injury.

<div align="center">
  
|    AIS   |   Severity |
|----------|:----------:|
|    1     |  Minor     |
|    2     |  Moderate  |
|    3     |  Serious   |
|    4     |  Severe    |
|    5     |  Critical  |
  
</div>

A common metric which can be used in determining the risk of such injuries is called the Head Injury Criterion or HIC. The Hic score is a measure of the likelihood of a head injury due to an impact.
