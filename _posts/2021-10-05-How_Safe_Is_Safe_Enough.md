There are many different organisations which evaluate vehicle safety, such as the New Car Assesment Programme <a href="https://www.globalncap.org/ncaps" target="_blank">(NCAP)</a> which opperates globally, The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety <a href="https://www.iihs.org/ratings" target="_blank">(IIHS)</a>  which is a US non profit organisation, or The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings" target="_blank">(NHTSA)</a> which is a department of the US government. These organisations score and rank vehicles on their safety preformance across many different areas. These areas include both occupant safety and pedestrian safety. The results of these tests all point towards the same thing, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/newer-cars-are-safer-cars">cars are getting safer</a>. In this post I will be looking at what it takes to get these high safety scores in terms of head impacts and to answer the question of *how safe is safe enough*.

When looking at head injury's a common metric which is used in determining the risk of such injuries is called the **Head Injury Criterion or HIC**. The higher the HIC score, the higher the risk of severe head injury.
